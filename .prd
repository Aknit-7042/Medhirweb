# Improving Your Dashboard UI Font Size and Readability

If you find the current font size and style of your Accountant Expense Panel UI unsatisfactory, here are expert recommendations for enhancing font choices, sizing, and overall table readability.

## Recommended Font Sizes for Dashboard UI

- **Body Text:** Use a minimum of 14px to 16px for main table content and general UI elements. This range is widely accepted for dashboards, balancing readability and information density[1][2].
- **Headers:** Make headers stand out by using 18px to 24px, depending on the importance and hierarchy. Larger headers help users quickly identify sections and columns[3][4].
- **Captions/Secondary Text:** Use 12px to 14px for less critical information, such as captions or footnotes, ensuring they remain readable but do not overpower main content[4].

## Best Fonts for Dashboard UI

- **Modern Sans-Serif Fonts:** Fonts like Roboto, Source Sans Pro, Inter, Poppins, and DM Sans are highly recommended for dashboards due to their clean appearance and excellent legibility at smaller sizes[5][6].
- **Font Pairing:** Use a bold or semi-bold weight for headers and regular weight for body text to create a clear visual hierarchy[5].
- **International Support:** Choose fonts that support multiple languages and have good x-height for clarity at smaller sizes[5][6].

## Table Readability and Visual Hierarchy

- **Bold Headers:** Use bold and slightly larger font sizes for table headers to make them distinct[7].
- **Row Striping:** Apply alternating background colors (“zebra stripes”) to table rows for easier scanning[7].
- **Alignment:** Left-align text columns and right-align numeric columns for better readability and comparison[8].
- **Spacing:** Increase row height and cell padding to give content more breathing room, making the table less cluttered[7][8].
- **Contrast:** Ensure high contrast between text and background for accessibility and ease of reading[7].

## Additional Typography Tips

- **Line Height:** Set line height to 120%–150% of the font size for optimal readability (e.g., 16px font size = 19–24px line height)[4].
- **Responsive Sizing:** Ensure font sizes and table layouts adapt well to different screen sizes for consistent usability[3].
- **Minimalist Design:** Avoid excessive borders or background fills; rely on white space, alignment, and grouping for a clean look[8].

| Element                  | Recommended Font Size |

| Table Body/Text          | 14–16px[1][2]        |
| Captions/Secondary Text  | 12–14px[4]           |

## Summary

- Use at least 14px–16px for main content, 18px+ for headers, and modern sans-serif fonts like Roboto or Source Sans Pro for clarity[1][5][6].
- Enhance readability with bold headers, proper alignment, row striping, and increased spacing[7][8].

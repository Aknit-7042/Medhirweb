Title: Expense Table Enhancements


1. Objective
Improve the usability, accessibility, and visual clarity of the expense table interface to enhance user experience, reduce visual fatigue, and improve task efficiency.

2. Features & Requirements

2.1 Visual Hierarchy and Readability
- Increase Row Spacing: Add vertical padding between table rows to reduce clutter and improve readability.
- Highlight Selected Filters: Use stronger visual cues (e.g., bold text, underline, color) to indicate the active filter such as “All”.

2.2 Usability Enhancements
- Bulk Actions: Add checkboxes to each row with a bulk actions dropdown (e.g., Mark as Paid, Delete, Export).
- Inline Editing: Enable inline editing for editable fields like Description, Category.
- Quick Filters: Provide quick filters such as Date Range, Amount Range, and Vendor Name for precise filtering.
- Sticky Table Headers: Keep column headers fixed on screen when scrolling down a long table.

2.3 Information Clarity
- Amount Formatting: Format monetary values with comma separators and clearly visible currency symbols.
- Tooltips: Add hover tooltips for truncated text (e.g., long descriptions) and action icons like “View Proof”.
- Status Color Coding: Use distinct colors and icons for each status type (Paid, Pending, Rejected) for fast recognition.

2.4 Accessibility
- Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all UI controls are reachable and usable via keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space).
- Screen Reader Support: Add ARIA labels, roles, and live regions to enhance compatibility with screen readers.
- Contrast Ratios: Ensure text, tags, and buttons meet WCAG 2.1 minimum contrast standards.

2.5 Additional Functionalities
- Export Options: Enable exporting the expense list to CSV, Excel, and PDF formats.
- Pagination or Infinite Scroll: Choose between paginated table or infinite scroll for better performance on large datasets.
- Detailed View Modal: Clicking a row should open a modal with full expense details and actions without leaving the page.

3. Success Metrics
- 25% decrease in support tickets related to UI confusion.
- 30% faster task completion time in user testing (e.g., locating and editing an expense).
- 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance on critical features.

4. Dependencies
- Design: Updated UI mockups for filters, tooltips, icons, and row spacing.
- Development: Frontend team (React/Vue/etc.), Backend team (if API updates needed for bulk actions/export).
- QA: Accessibility testing, keyboard nav checks, and tooltips on hover.
